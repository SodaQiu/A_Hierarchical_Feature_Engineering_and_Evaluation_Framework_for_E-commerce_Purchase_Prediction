## Research Content

With the rapid growth of e-commerce, accurately predicting user purchasing behavior has become essential for enhancing platform competitiveness. However, existing studies often lack a generalizable feature engineering framework that systematically transforms raw behavior logs into high-value predictive signals. To address this gap, this study proposes and validates a three-layer feature engineering framework using real-world data from Alibaba. The framework organizes features into Basic (Basic Features), Conversion (Conversion Rate and Behavior Stability), and Advanced layers (Overall Activity and advanced Interactions). To systematically quantify model performance, this study devised a hierarchical evaluation method that quantifies marginal feature contribution layer by layer. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework improves the F1 score from 0.61 to 0.68, and up to 0.96 in controlled experiments, although this may reflect dataset-specific factors and should be further validated on larger-scale data. Overall, the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical feature design and provide a systematic and interpretable approach for user behavior modeling in e-commerce.

Note: The raw user behavior logs are preprocessed, and feature engineering is performed to construct multi-layer features. The extracted features are then used to predict user purchase behavior.
